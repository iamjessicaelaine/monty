# Project 0x19: C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.l
# About the Program
**Getting Started:** After cloning the repositry your local machine, compile the
program with the command `gcc *.c -o monty` and then you can call the program
with the command `./monty` followed by the file containing the bytecode.\n
**Usage:** `monty file`
- where **file** is the path to the file containing Monty byte code
The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stops if either:
- it ececuted properly every line of the file
- it finds an error in the file
- an error occurred
